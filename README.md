ROSS - Ros for Space Applications
=================================

ROSS is intended to be a collection of applications designed for the use in Space applications. The goal is to privide a plug-and-play solution. This project will contain the core files for a suit of programs based on ROS1.0 and ROS2.0 for space applications and autonomous planetary rover mission scenarios.

The project consists of two core worklines for ROS1.0 and for ROS2.0. These can be extended by system specific software repositories. The core applications are designed to widely applicable in space mission scenarios, independently from the designated platform. 

# Currently planned packages are:

## ROS:

* Task Management
* Radio Communication Protocol Software
* Telemetry Viewer
* Telecommander 
* Operations Databank Manager

## ROS2.0:

* ADS
* ACS
* Sensor Skeleton
* Actor Skeleton
* Sensor Simulation
* Actor Simulation

* Task Management
* Radio communication protocol software
* CAN Interface
* Orbit Simulator
